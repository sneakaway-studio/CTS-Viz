# CTS-Viz





## Instructions

### Install Project

1. Install git, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [git-lfs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage), [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), Unity (see [version](./ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt))
1. Download project (the green button on this [repo](https://github.com/sneakaway-studio/CTS-Viz))
1. Install Submodule (see [instructions](https://github.com/sneakaway-studio/SneakawayUtilities))
1. Add project: Unity Hub > (drop down next to Open) > Add project from disk 

### Open Project

1. Open project: Unity Hub > click once on project name
1. Open scene: Unity Project > Scenes > Visualization
1. Change your Unity UI to look like the screenshot below.
1. Click Play button


### Select a timezone

1. Open project (see above)
1. Select the VizManager game object in Hierarchy
1. Expand the Scriptables > VizSettings folder in Project
1. Drag the specific visualization file to the VizSettings field in the VizManager
1. Click Play button


### Export Video 

#### Setup
1. Open project (see above)
1. Open Unity Recorder: Window > General > Recorder > Recorder Window
1. Dock the Recorder window below the Game view

#### For each timezone

1. Change settings on Recorder as needed
2. Select a timezone (see above)
3. Update the file name settings. For example, these `<wild cards>`: 

```
00-00-01-<Date>-<Time>-<Resolution>-<Take>
``` 

will be replaced in the filename of the exported video: 

```
00-00-01-spain-canary-islands-lotus-berthelotii-20220817-095839-4K-24H.mp4
```

4. Set the correct resolution `640x1080` in the Game window
5. Click the red play button in the Recorder. It will record until you (or the Recording Mode settings) exit play mode.


### Unity Recorder FAQ

[Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@2.0/manual/index.html) can capture and save video from Unity, including game play and other user interactions. A good place to start is the [Unity Recorder Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-unity-recorder#) and [advanced usage with timeline to move camera around scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlDJoCuJ1E&ab_channel=TheTrueDuck)

## To do

- [X] Randomizer
- [X] Set up project, Git, LFS
- [X] SVG Export
	- [X] Create basic test for viz
	- [X] Copy all SVG to `svg-randomizer` (on Mac Pro)
	- [X] Then convert to PNGs
	- [X] Then copy PNGs to Unity folder
- [X] Create new submodule for utilities
 	- [X] Import into this project
	- [ ] Copy all `Scripts/_Common/` from previous (Graverobbers)
- [X] Video Export
	- [X] Add Unity Recorder
	- [X] Create FAQ ([see below](#unity-recorder-faq))
	- [X] Make tests, give to Joelle
	- [X] Make videos for 6 different locations, give to Joelle
		- [X] ...she edits into 3 or 6 div
- [X] Time Class
	- [X] 24 hour clock (controllable starttime, endtime, and timeScale)
	- [X] Display clock
	- [X] Move basic "sun"
	- [X] Function to update things if game pauses
	- [X] Control basic light
- [X] Visualization
 	- [X] Display basic randomized, with controls
 	- [X] Change to savable configuration method to repeat visuals w/o losing settings
- [X] Animation
	- [X] Remove glitch from parent emotion (gimbal lock)
	- [X] Change from LeanTween to DOTween
	- [X] Config files save edits to animation settings
	- [X] Make Save Config button
	- [X] Make workflow like this:
		- [X] 1. Create new config file button
		- [X] 2. Drag config file to visualizer game object
		- [X] 3. Make animations, change properties, etc
		- [X] 4. Just change VizSettings file to update values in config file with current values of animation
- [ ] UI
	- [X] Add control viz buttons
	- [ ] Add overlay with instructions?
- [X] Sky
	- [X] Use gradient for background / lighting
	- [X] Use actual sunset? https://github.com/Mursaat/SunriseSunset
- [ ] Brainstorming for conversations later
	- [ ] Exhibition
		- [X] New doc: Compare Raspberry Pi vs. Micca vs. BrightSign
		- [ ] New doc: Spec out / budget multiple bezel free monitors
		- [ ] New doc: Encapsulate research / solutions for removing gradient banding
		- [ ] Link from "High Res Files..."
	- [ ] Potential Mobile App
		- [ ] Notification points you to app when sunsets
		- [ ] Keep things modular to make mobile version performant
		- [ ] Build mobile app welcome screen in a new scene
		- [X] In SVG exporters, make sure there is an option to produce differenct size PNGs for app
		- [X] SVG export should mimic same structure as original project (sunset data)
- [ ] Potential performance improvements
	- [ ] Add Object Pool
    - [ ] Others?
- [ ] Visual improvements
	- [ ] Fix muddy color transition 
    - [ ] Improve leaves 
        - [ ] Add ripple effect with shaders or mesh deformation to the leaves
        - [ ] Show shadows falling on leaves
        - [ ] Show light through semi-transparent leaves 
        - [ ] Experiment with lighting cookie on leaves (to fake shadows)  
- [ ] Video improvements
    - [ ] Logistics: It would be great if we could click record once and Unity rendered all 24 videos automatically.
    - [ ] Render quality: Right now, the only acceptable quality version is HUGE. Need a truth table comparing
    	- [ ] different codecs
    	- [ ] different resolutions
     	- [ ] different monitors (of different qualities, resolutions)
      	- [ ] different devices (to make sure these can actually play on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 )
